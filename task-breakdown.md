# PurseAI Frontend-Backend Integration Tasks

This document outlines the tasks required to implement the interfaces for front-end and back-end interaction as defined in `interface.md`.

## Overview

The implementation will focus on two main aspects:
1. Creating a test account with mock interfaces for testing the front-end
2. Implementing real backend API calls for non-test accounts

## Task Breakdown

### 1. API Service Structure Setup
- [x] Create API service interfaces for each feature area (Authentication, Savings, Billing, Summary, AI Assistant)
- [x] Create mock implementations for test account
- [x] Create real API implementations for regular accounts
- [x] Create a service factory to return the appropriate implementation based on the user account

### 2. Authentication Implementation
- [x] Modify `LoginRegisterController` to use API services
- [x] Implement special handling for test account (username: "test", password: "test")
- [x] Implement special handling for admin account (username: "admin", password: "admin")
- [x] Add token storage and management for authenticated sessions

### 3. Savings Plan Implementation
- [x] Implement mock savings plan API for test account
- [x] Implement real savings plan API for regular accounts
- [x] Update `SavingViewController` to use the appropriate service

### 4. Billing Implementation
- [x] Implement mock billing API for test account
- [x] Implement real billing API for regular accounts
- [ ] Update `BillingViewController` to use the appropriate service

### 5. Summary Implementation
- [x] Implement mock summary API for test account
- [x] Implement real summary API for regular accounts
- [ ] Update `SummaryViewController` to use the appropriate service

### 6. AI Assistant Implementation
- [x] Implement mock AI assistant API for test account
- [x] Implement real AI assistant API for regular accounts
- [x] Update `AIViewController` to use the appropriate service

### 7. User Settings Implementation
- [x] Implement mock user settings API for test account
- [x] Implement real user settings API for regular accounts
- [ ] Update settings view to use the appropriate service

### 8. Testing
- [ ] Test all mock implementations with test account
- [ ] Test all real implementations with regular accounts
- [ ] Test admin account functionality

## Implementation Details

### API Service Factory
The service factory will determine which implementation to return based on the username:
- For username "test", return mock implementations
- For username "admin", return real implementations but with special handling during login
- For all other usernames, return real implementations

### Mock Data
Mock implementations will use in-memory data structures to simulate backend functionality:
- Pre-populated savings plans
- Sample billing entries
- Realistic summary data
- Simulated AI responses

### Error Handling
All API calls will include proper error handling:
- Network errors
- Authentication errors
- Validation errors
- Server errors
