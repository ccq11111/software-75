# PurseAI Frontend-Backend Integration Implementation Summary

## Completed Tasks

1. **API Service Structure Setup**
   - Created API service interfaces for all feature areas (Authentication, Savings, Billing, Summary, AI Assistant, User Settings)
   - Implemented mock implementations for test account
   - Implemented real API implementations for regular accounts
   - Created a service factory to return the appropriate implementation based on the user account

2. **Authentication Implementation**
   - Modified `LoginRegisterController` to use API services
   - Implemented special handling for test account (username: "test", password: "test")
   - Implemented special handling for admin account (username: "admin", password: "admin")
   - Added token storage and management for authenticated sessions

3. **Savings Plan Implementation**
   - Implemented mock savings plan API for test account
   - Implemented real savings plan API for regular accounts
   - Updated `SavingViewController` to use the appropriate service

4. **AI Assistant Implementation**
   - Implemented mock AI assistant API for test account
   - Implemented real AI assistant API for regular accounts
   - Updated `AIViewController` to use the appropriate service

## Remaining Tasks

1. **Billing Implementation**
   - Update `BillingViewController` to use the appropriate service

2. **Summary Implementation**
   - Update `SummaryViewController` to use the appropriate service

3. **User Settings Implementation**
   - Update settings view to use the appropriate service

4. **Testing**
   - Test all mock implementations with test account
   - Test all real implementations with regular accounts
   - Test admin account functionality

## Implementation Details

### API Service Factory
The `ApiServiceFactory` class determines which implementation to return based on the username:
- For username "test", it returns mock implementations
- For username "admin", it returns real implementations but with special handling during login
- For all other usernames, it returns real implementations

### Mock Implementations
Mock implementations use in-memory data structures to simulate backend functionality:
- Pre-populated savings plans
- Sample billing entries
- Realistic summary data
- Simulated AI responses

### Real Implementations
Real implementations make HTTP requests to the backend API:
- All requests include proper authentication headers
- Responses are parsed into model objects
- Errors are handled and propagated to the UI

### Error Handling
All API calls include proper error handling:
- Network errors
- Authentication errors
- Validation errors
- Server errors

## Testing Instructions

To test the implementation:
1. Login with username "test" and password "test" to use mock implementations
2. Login with username "admin" and password "admin" to use real implementations with admin privileges
3. Login with any other username/password to use real implementations

## Next Steps

After completing the remaining tasks, we should:
1. Add comprehensive error handling throughout the application
2. Implement caching for frequently accessed data
3. Add offline support for basic functionality
4. Improve the user experience with loading indicators and better error messages
